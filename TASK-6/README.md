# Augmented Reality Web App

## Project Overview

This is a simple Augmented Reality (AR) web application that uses A-Frame and AR.js to render 3D objects on top of an AR marker using the user's webcam. The project demonstrates how web-based AR can be implemented directly in the browser without requiring native mobile apps or additional installations.

As an example, this project features a 3D solar system that appears when a camera is pointed at a predefined marker (such as the Hiro marker).

## Technologies Used

- HTML
- A-Frame
- AR.js
- JavaScript
- WebRTC (for webcam access)

## Features

- Marker-based AR experience.
- 3D solar system rendered using A-Frame primitives.
- Marker recognition using the user's webcam.
- Works directly in modern browsers.
